alias explain='gemini "Explain in simple terms: "'
```

## Integration with Development Workflows

### Git Integration

Integrate Gemini CLI with your Git workflow:

```bash
# Generate commit messages
git diff --cached | gemini "Generate a concise commit message for these changes"

# Review pull requests
git diff main | gemini "Review this code and suggest improvements"
```

### IDE Integration

You can integrate Gemini CLI with your favorite IDE:

**VS Code Integration:**
```json
// settings.json
{
    "terminal.integrated.env.linux": {
        "GOOGLE_API_KEY": "your-api-key"
    }
}
```

**Custom VS Code Tasks:**
```json
// tasks.json
{
    "version": "2.0.0",
    "tasks": [
        {
            "label": "Ask Gemini",
            "type": "shell",
            "command": "gemini",
            "args": ["${input:question}"],
            "group": "build"
        }
    ],
    "inputs": [
        {
            "id": "question",
            "description": "Your question for Gemini",
            "default": "",
            "type": "promptString"
        }
    ]
}
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Be Specific with Prompts

Instead of:
```bash
gemini "Help me with Python"
```

Use:
```bash
gemini "I'm building a web scraper in Python using BeautifulSoup. How do I handle rate limiting and avoid being blocked?"
```

### 2. Use Context Effectively

Provide relevant context for better results:

```bash
gemini --file config.py --file main.py "Given these configuration files, explain how the application handles authentication"
```

### 3. Iterate and Refine

Don't expect perfect results on the first try:

```bash
# First attempt
gemini "Create a Python class for user management"

# Refine based on output
gemini "The previous class needs to include password hashing and email validation. Here's what you generated: [paste output]"
```

### 4. Manage API Usage

Monitor your API usage to avoid unexpected costs:

```bash
# Check your current usage
gemini usage

# Set usage limits
gemini config set max_daily_requests 1000
```

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Authentication Problems

If you're having authentication issues:

```bash
# Re-authenticate
gcloud auth login

# Check your API key
echo $GOOGLE_API_KEY

# Test the connection
gemini "Hello" --verbose
```

### Rate Limiting

If you hit rate limits:

```bash
# Check your current usage
gemini usage

# Wait and retry, or use a different model
gemini --model gemini-pro-vision "Your question here"
```

### Installation Issues

If installation fails:

```bash
# Update pip
pip install --upgrade pip

# Install with specific version
pip install google-generativeai==0.3.0

# Check Python version
python --version
```

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Code Review Assistant

```bash
# Review a pull request
git diff origin/main | gemini "Review this code for:
1. Security vulnerabilities
2. Performance issues
3. Best practices violations
4. Potential bugs"
```

### Example 2: Documentation Generator

```bash
# Generate API documentation
gemini --file api.py "Generate comprehensive API documentation including:
- Endpoint descriptions
- Request/response examples
- Error codes
- Authentication requirements"
```

### Example 3: Data Analysis Helper

```bash
# Analyze sales data
gemini --file sales_data.csv "Analyze this sales data and provide:
1. Key trends and patterns
2. Recommendations for improvement
3. Potential issues to investigate
4. Visualizations to create"
```

## Advanced Tips and Tricks

### 1. Chain Commands

Combine multiple Gemini calls for complex tasks:

```bash
# Generate code, then optimize it
gemini "Create a Python web scraper" > scraper.py
gemini --file scraper.py "Optimize this code for performance and add error handling" > optimized_scraper.py
```

### 2. Use Templates

Create reusable templates for common tasks:

```bash
# Template for code review
echo "Review this code for:
- Security issues
- Performance problems
- Best practices
- Readability" > review_template.txt

gemini --file code.py --file review_template.txt
```

### 3. Batch Processing

Process multiple files at once:

```bash
# Review all Python files in a directory
for file in *.py; do
    echo "=== Reviewing $file ==="
    gemini --file "$file" "Review this code"
    echo ""
done
```

## Security Considerations

### API Key Management

Always protect your API key:

```bash
# Use environment variables
export GOOGLE_API_KEY="your-key"

# Or use a secure credential manager
echo "export GOOGLE_API_KEY='your-key'" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

### Input Validation

Be careful with user input:

```bash
# Sanitize inputs before sending to Gemini
read -p "Enter your question: " question
sanitized_question=$(echo "$question" | sed 's/[^a-zA-Z0-9 ]//g')
gemini "$sanitized_question"
```
